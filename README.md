# Intelligent Agent, a definition.
An agent is a computer system that is capable of independent action on behalf of its user or
owner (figuring out what needs to be done to satisfy design objectives, rather than constantly 
being told).
# Multi Agent System (MAS)
A multiagent system (MAS) is one thatconsists of a number of agents, which interact with one-another. In the most general case, agents will 
be acting on behalf of users with different goals and motivations. To successfully interact, they will require the ability to cooperate,
coordinate, and negotiate with each other, much as people do.
# Jason
Jason is an interpreter for an extended version of AgentSpeak developed by Jomi F. Hübner and Rafael H. Bordini, based on previous work 
done with many colleagues, in particular Michael Fisher, Joyce Martins, Álvaro Moreira, Renata Vieira, Willem Visser, Mike Wooldridge, but
also many others. It implements the operational semantics of that language, and provides a platform for the development of multi-agent
systems, with many user-customisable features. Jason is available Open Source, and is distributed under GNU LGPL.
